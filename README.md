# 379

this is a pcb replacement for the noxary 378. pinout isn't the same.

pcb edge cuts were provided by islandworks studio.

thanks to invis and chippy for providing plate file, xondat discord is shut down so you can't get in no more.

thanks to xyz for simple stm boot circuit.

untested. good luck.
